# minishell

First pair project of the 42 Core Curriculum.

Summary:
"This project is about creating a simple shell.
Yes, your own little bash.
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors."

Besides getting a good understanding of how Bash works, the project also taught us a lot about project management and communication including working with git. We worked from the beginning in a structured way and organized our work in Trello. We sliced the big project in small pieces and made sure our shell is working properly after each implementation. One of us was concetrating on the parsing, while the other person took the ownership of execution. We finalized the project together and took the time for proper testing to make sure everything is working as intended.

Score: 100/100
